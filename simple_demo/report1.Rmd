```{r echo=FALSE,results=FALSE}
library(car)
library(xtable)
library(ggplot2)
load("linmod.RData")
```

The results are summarised as
```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
print(xtable(summary(lm1), caption = "Linear Regression Coefficients"),
      caption.placement = "top")
```

The fitted linear model was a good fit except there appears to be an
outlier as seen in plots below.
```{r echo=FALSE, results='hold'}
gplot1
gplot2
```
